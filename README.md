# MNIST Deep Learning with TensorFlow
This repository contains a deep learning model built using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model uses a feed-forward neural network (FNN) architecture with two hidden layers and ReLU activation functions. The project demonstrates how to preprocess the MNIST dataset, build and train a neural network, and evaluate its performance.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Data scaling and batching using TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS).
**Model Architecture:** A simple neural network with two hidden layers and ReLU activation.
**Training & Evaluation:** The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
**Hyperparameter Exploration:** Experimentation with various hidden layer sizes and numbers of hidden layers, batch sizes etc.. (part 7 file).
