# MNIST-Tutorial
This repository contains a deep learning model built with TensorFlow to classify MNIST handwritten digits. The motivation was to practicalize the theory learned in neural networks and gain hands-on experience. It includes data preprocessing, a simple neural network with ReLU activations, and hyperparameter experiments.
